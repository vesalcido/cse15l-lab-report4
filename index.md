* The ouput showed some information on when the last time I logged in and basically gave a confirmation that I successfully have logged into my account.

## Clone your fork of the repository from GitHub Account

* To be able to clone the repository from my personal github account I was able to skip out of typing the whole line of code, since it was found in one of the lab tasks. So, I was able to < command -c > and < command -v > to be able to past the desired fork that I wanted to clone. Overall, the commands < command -c > and < command -v > helped me save a lot of time in the long run.

Output:

* The output shows the for actaully being cloned in the terminal, which is a pretty neat sight to see.

## Running the tests, to demonstrate that they fail
The first step that I took before I did some of the commands below:

* The commands that I pressed on my keyboard were: < ls > < enter > < cd lab7 > < enter > < ls > < enter >
* After pressing those commands, I was able to find the commands to run the actual tests to view that they were failing in the lab tasks. Once I found the commands in the lab tasks, I < command -c > and < command -v > to copy and paste both commands one at a time to show that the tests were failing.
* Output:
